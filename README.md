# Gabriel's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles.

- Most useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin`
- Settings are for the following:
    - nvim (text editor & IDE)
    - zsh (shell)
    - (lf) (file manager)
    - sxiv (image viewer)
    - miscs like xdg defaults, inputrc, rss urls, blender configs.

- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`


## Usage

These dotfiles were firstly intended to be auto-installed with a bash script which is being replaced by a playbook that automates my personal Arch Linux installation for idempotence, which will be made available and linked here soon.
